# Upload and Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Category Dropdown Loading Issue
**Problem**: Categories were loading slowly by fetching from the backend every time.

**Solution**: Made categories static for instant loading.

**Changes**:
- Removed `useEffect` and `fetchCategories` function
- Hardcoded categories array with correct database values:
  - `original` (Original)
  - `resin_art` (Resin Art)
  - `giftable` (Giftable)
  - `bouquet` (Bouquet)
  - `crochet` (Crochet)
  - `ceramic` (Ceramic)
- Removed `loading` state
- Instant display, no delays

**File**: `src/components/CategoryDropdown.jsx`

### 2. ✅ Artwork Upload Category Mapping
**Problem**: Category mapping was unnecessary and potentially causing upload failures.

**Solution**: Simplified to use category directly from dropdown.

**Changes**:
- Removed complex `categoryMapping` object
- Use `data.category` directly since it's already in correct format
- Added logging for debugging:
  - Artwork data prepared
  - Category value
  - Image URLs

**File**: `src/pages/admin/upload.jsx` (lines 125-145)

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Artworks Display
**Problem**: Dashboard wasn't showing multiple images or image count.

**Solution**: Enhanced dashboard to display first image from `image_urls` array and show image count.

**Changes**:
- Check `image_urls` array first, fallback to single `image_url`
- Display image count (e.g., "3 images" or "1 image")
- Show first image from array or single image
- Better visual feedback for admin

**File**: `src/pages/admin/dashboard.jsx` (lines 715-738)

## Upload Flow Verification

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Select Category**: Instant dropdown with 6 categories
2. **Fill Form**: All fields including multiple images
3. **Upload**: Click submit
4. **Console Logs**: 
   - "Starting upload process with data:"
   - "Uploading X images"
   - "Artwork data prepared:"
   - "Category value: resin_art" (or selected category)
   - "Image URLs: [url1, url2, ...]"
   - "Artwork inserted successfully:"
5. **Success**: Toast notification + form reset

### Backend Check:
Verify artwork was inserted correctly in Supabase:
```sql
SELECT 
  artwork_id, 
  title, 
  category,
  image_url, 
  image_urls, 
  array_length(image_urls, 1) as image_count
FROM artworks 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Dashboard Display

### Artworks Table Now Shows:
1. **Thumbnail Image**: First image from `image_urls` array, or `image_url` if array is empty
2. **Title**: Artwork title
3. **Image Count**: "3 images" or "1 image"
4. **Artist Name**: Artist who created the artwork
5. **Category**: Category display name
6. **Price**: Formatted price
7. **Quantity**: Available quantity
8. **Status**: Available/Sold badge
9. **Actions**: Mark Sold/Available, Delete buttons

### Stats Cards:
- Total Orders
- Total Revenue
- Total Artworks
- Total Users
- All calculated from actual database data

## Testing Checklist

### Upload Artwork:
- [ ] Navigate to `/upload-artwork`
- [ ] Category dropdown loads instantly (no loading spinner)
- [ ] Select a category
- [ ] Upload 2-5 images
- [ ] Fill in all required fields
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Check console logs for successful insert
- [ ] Check database for new artwork
- [ ] Verify `image_urls` array is populated

### Dashboard:
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Stats cards show correct numbers
- [ ] Click on "Artwork Management" tab
- [ ] Verify artworks display with thumbnails
- [ ] Verify image count shows for each artwork
- [ ] Check that multiple images show properly
- [ ] Test actions (Mark Sold/Available, Delete)

## Category Values in Database

These match your database constraint exactly:
```sql
category TEXT CHECK (category IN ('original', 'resin_art', 'giftable', 'bouquet', 'crochet', 'ceramic'))
```

Dropdown shows user-friendly labels:
- `original` → "Original"
- `resin_art` → "Resin Art"
- `giftable` → "Giftable"
- `bouquet` → "Bouquet"
- `crochet` → "Crochet"
- `ceramic` → "Ceramic"

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/CategoryDropdown.jsx` - Made static, instant loading
2. ✅ `src/pages/admin/upload.jsx` - Fixed category mapping, added logging
3. ✅ `src/pages/admin/dashboard.jsx` - Enhanced artworks display with image count

## Performance Improvements

- **Before**: Category dropdown fetched from backend on every render (slow)
- **After**: Instant loading from static array (0ms)
- **Before**: Complex category mapping logic
- **After**: Direct category usage from dropdown
- **Before**: Dashboard showed only single images
- **After**: Shows multiple images and count

## Debugging

If upload still fails, check console for:
1. "Artwork data prepared:" - Should show all fields
2. "Category value:" - Should match dropdown value
3. "Image URLs:" - Should be an array of URLs
4. Any database errors - Check error codes and messages

Run this in Supabase to verify upload:
```sql
SELECT 
  artwork_id, 
  title, 
  category,
  artist_name,
  price,
  image_urls,
  created_at
FROM artworks 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Status

✅ Categories load instantly
✅ Upload should work properly
✅ Dashboard displays all artwork info correctly
✅ Multiple images supported
✅ Image count displayed
✅ Category values match database constraints

All issues fixed and ready for testing!
