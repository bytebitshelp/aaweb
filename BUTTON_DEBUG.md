## If Button Still Doesn't Work

### Check These:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Form validation messages
4. JavaScript errors
5. Supabase connection

### Manual Test:
Try this in browser console:
```javascript
// Get the form element
const form = document.querySelector('form[onSubmit]')
// Trigger submit
form.dispatchEvent(new Event('submit'))
```

This should trigger the form submission.
