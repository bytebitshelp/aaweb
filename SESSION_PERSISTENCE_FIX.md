# Session Persistence Fix

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Auth State Change Handler
- **Before**: Was clearing user state on any null session event
- **After**: Only clears on explicit `SIGNED_OUT` event
- **Why**: Supabase handles token refresh internally - null sessions during refresh don't mean user is logged out

### 2. Improved Session Initialization
- Always verifies session with Supabase on page load
- Uses cached session for initial render (faster UI)
- Verifies cached session matches Supabase session

### 3. Enhanced Session Persistence
- Supabase client configured with `persistSession: true` and `autoRefreshToken: true`
- Backup session stored in localStorage as `sb-session`
- Session persists across page refreshes and browser restarts

### 4. Fixed Sign In Flow
- Properly waits for profile fetch before redirect
- Ensures session is saved before navigation
- Uses `window.location.replace` instead of `assign` to preserve state

## ‚úÖ What Should Work Now

1. **User stays logged in** across:
   - Page refreshes
   - Browser restarts (if cookies/localStorage not cleared)
   - Token refresh (automatic)

2. **Session restoration**:
   - On app load, checks Supabase session first
   - Falls back to cached session if Supabase is slow
   - Verifies session is still valid

3. **No unwanted logouts**:
   - Only logs out on explicit sign out action
   - Handles token refresh gracefully
   - Network errors don't clear session

## üß™ Testing

1. **Sign in** - should save session
2. **Refresh page** - should stay logged in
3. **Close and reopen browser** - should stay logged in (if cookies not cleared)
4. **Wait for token refresh** - should maintain session automatically

## üêõ If Still Having Issues

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Check localStorage**:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
   - Look for `sb-auth-token` (Supabase's key)
   - Look for `sb-session` (our backup)
3. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Verify user exists and is confirmed
4. **Clear and retry**:
   - Clear all localStorage
   - Clear browser cache
   - Sign in again

## üìù Key Code Changes

### AuthContext.jsx
- Changed `onAuthStateChange` to only clear on `SIGNED_OUT`
- Improved session initialization flow
- Better error handling for session restoration

### supabase.js
- Already configured with `persistSession: true`
- Auto-refresh tokens enabled

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Supabase stores session in localStorage under `sb-auth-token` key
- We also backup to `sb-session` for faster initial render
- Session expires after the JWT expiration time (usually 1 hour)
- Token refresh happens automatically if `autoRefreshToken: true`
